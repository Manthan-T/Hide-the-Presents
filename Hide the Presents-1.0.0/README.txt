Notes on the game's code:

1) Although using arrays was a decent way of managing entities, creating instances of classes of entities would have been better. This could also be used to reset their locations after moving on from a game state more efficiently.

2) Collision detection was managed using coordinates until level 4 with the buggies, (after which intersections between hitboxes was used for new entities.) Without this the game would likely have been impossible to complete.

3) Brackets need to be more consistent but it doesn't really matter (if you look closely at the code you'll know what I mean.)

4) Just see the Screen_Size.java file.

5) Audio issues are because of the songs not the code (Youtube was acting up).

6) May be a couple of bugs but idc.

7) Also graphics
